helper project to build target-specific code for coroutines, since cmake apparently still can't (easily) do architecture specific compilation in 2020. Based on [github.com/hnes/libaco](https://github.com/hnes/libaco) (commit `e3058b3`) for x86 and [github.com/llenck/yaco](https://github.com/llenck/yaco) (version will probably be changed every now and then) for arm. Will mainly be used as a helper for [github.com/llenck/h2o-wrapper](https://github.com/llenck/h2o-wrapper), so there might be a few api breaks every now and then.
